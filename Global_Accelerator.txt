How it works
AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability, performance, and security of your public applications. Global Accelerator provides two global static public IPs that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints, such as Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, and elastic IPs.

AWS Global Accelerator connects end users to load balancers in up to 10 Regions within the AWS global network.
