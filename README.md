Weather Application With AWS Optimization


Overview
Developed a front-end weather application to provide real-time weather information for both current and custom locations. To ensure optimal performance and low latency, the application was deployed across multiple AWS regions using EC2 instances and a Network Load Balancer (NLB).

Key Features:

Real-Time Weather Data: Integrated with a weather API to fetch and display up-to-date weather conditions.
Multi-Location Support: Enabled users to view weather information for their current location and other specified locations.
AWS Deployment: Deployed the application on EC2 instances in multiple AWS regions for improved performance and availability.
Network Load Balancing: Implemented NLB to distribute incoming traffic across instances based on user location, minimizing latency.
Technical Implementation:

Front-End: Developed a user-friendly interface using [Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue)] to display weather data.
AWS Infrastructure:
Deployed EC2 instances in multiple regions to distribute application load.
Configured NLB to route traffic based on user location for optimal performance.
Implemented auto-scaling and load balancing for high availability.
Leveraged AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch, S3) for monitoring and storage.
Achievements:

Successfully developed a scalable and responsive weather application.
Optimized application performance by leveraging AWS infrastructure and NLB.
Improved user experience by providing low-latency weather updates.
Demonstrated proficiency in front-end development and AWS cloud technologies.
